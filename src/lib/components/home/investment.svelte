We are looking to raise between $10k to max $20k to speed up the development of Arenace project. As an early investor and supporter, you will get a % share of your participation amount from part of the species nfts sale which will be exactly $250k to be reserved.The nfts will take part from 2 to 3 monts sell period and any amount raised from the nfts blind box sale, the early investors and supporters will still have their return of share percentage calculated against the $250k set as distribution amount.<br />
Ex: if your participation amount is $1000, your percentage share will be 1% of the $250k which gives you $2500 as a return of investment after the nfts sale period.
